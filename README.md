# Data Structures & Algorithms (C++)

This repository contains my **practice projects and implementations** of core **Data Structures and Algorithms** using **C++**.

## Purpose

* Understand data structures deeply through implementation
* Practice algorithms step by step
* Improve problem-solving and pointer/memory handling
* Prepare for technical interviews

## Contents

**Data Structures:**

* Singly Linked List
* Doubly Linked List
* Stack
* Queue

**Algorithms:**

* Searching (Linear, Binary)
* Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick)

## Tech Stack

* Language: C++ (C++17)
* Compiler: g++

## Notes

* Implementations are written from scratch (no STL)
* Focus on clean code and correct memory management

⭐ Feel free to explore the code and give feedback.
